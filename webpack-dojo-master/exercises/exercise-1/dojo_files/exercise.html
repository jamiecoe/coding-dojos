<p>
  To get started we'll be going through the layout of the dojo's exercises and make sure everything's in working order.
</p>

<h2>Project Layout</h2>
<p>
  Let's go through the project's structure. Any files not mentioned here can be ignored.
</p>
<p>
  The main files you'll be touching are under the <code>exercises</code> directory.
  Here you'll find directories for each exercise which in turn contain the following:
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Path</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Editable?</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>webpack.config.js</td>
    <td>This is the file you'll be building up to understand how Webpack is configured.</td>
    <td class="bg-success text-light">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>webpack.config.test.js</td>
    <td>This file contains the tests to validate you've configured the webpack.config.js correctly.</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>src</td>
    <td>A directory containing all of the dependencies used by this project.</td>
    <td class="bg-success text-light">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dojo_files</td>
    <td>
      This directory contains files used to present the exercise for the dojo.
    </td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
  This page you're viewing is hooked up to a server which is watching the exercise's files for changes. When any changes
  are detected, the tests are re-run and the page automatically updates itself.
  There's no need for you to run the tests or Webpack manually!
</p>

<h3>Webpack Output Panel</h3>
<p>
  The panel you see to your right is the output from Webpack. This is useful to understand as we go through each
  exercise. Not all of it is important, but we'll be picking out bits and pieces.
</p>

<h2>Your First Tasks</h2>

<p>
  So hopefully, you have a rough idea of what you're working with. To test your understanding, below you'll see a
  failing task in yellow. What's the issue? An explanation is provided immediately afterwards. <strong>If you know a bit of
  Webpack already, try making it pass before you read the solution.</strong> For debug output, you can click the "Fail" button.
</p>

<div id="1.1" class="test-case"></div>

<pre><code class="javascript">
const path = require('path')

const inputPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
const outputPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')

module.exports = {
  context: inputPath,
  entry: {
    index: ['./index.js']
  },
  output: {
    path: outputPath,
    filename: '[name].js'
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  We're doing a few additional steps than necessary to keep things organised. Here's the rundown.
</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>context</td>
    <td>Sets the root path to resolve all inputs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>entry</td>
    <td>A map of entry names to entry files. All the files are grouped into a single bundle.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>output.path</td>
    <td>Where to write the final bundle.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>output.filename</td>
    <td>The output filename for every entry bundle. We can use template strings here.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Entry Map</h3>
<p>
  The <code>entry</code> map defines Webpack's starting points when it parses your source code. From these files,
  it'll read and gather all external dependencies (using <code>require</code> or <code>import</code> keywords).
</p>
<p>
  The key of the map is the <code>name</code> used in the output file. The values are the source files to parse.
</p>
<p>
  We'll go into this in detail in a later exercise. Right now, if you open the <code>src</code> directory, you'll
  see our source code has no dependencies.
</p>

<h3>The Output Path</h3>
<p>
  The <code>output.path</code> isn't needed for this task as we're focusing on Webpack's output rather than any
  filesystem changes. This dojo will be entirely run in-memory so you won't see any files being written to disk.
  However, it's generally good practice to be explicit on where your files are going.
</p>

<h3>The Output Filename</h3>
<p>
  The <code>output.filename</code> is also not needed for this task as <code>[name].js</code> is actually the default.
  I've added it to show how we can change the output names of the entry bundles.
</p>
<p>
  Now for your next task. <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-filename" target="_blank">Read up on
  <code>output.filename</code></a> and change the output names so that it also contains a hash representation
  of the bundle such that the <code>index</code> entry becomes <code>index-abc123.js</code>.
</p>

<div id="1.2" class="test-case"></div>

<pre><code class="javascript">
const path = require('path')

const inputPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')
const outputPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')

module.exports = {
  context: inputPath,
  entry: {
    index: ['./index.js']
  },
  output: {
    path: outputPath,
    filename: '[name]-[hash].js'
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  That's all for this exercise! You should now have a rough idea of how these exercises will be run.
</p>
<p>
  You can move on to the next exercise to actually start learning about Webpack.
